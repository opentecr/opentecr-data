        "comments": "Keq was extracted from the abstract and also found in 'Table 1' (page 4 of the pdf, page 2024 of the journal). For the equilibrium measurement, neither pH nor temperature were explicitly given. The pH might be assumed to be 8.1 , as this value was given as 'optimal pH', and is also mentioned in the section 'Assay of MTR-1-P isomerase' (page 2 of pdf, p. 2022 of journal). The temperature might have been (273.15+35)K, as the section 'Assay of MTR-1-P isomerase' (page 2 of pdf, p. 2022 of journal) and a small comment (page 6 of the pdf, page 2026 of the journal) indicates. No exact information about reaction conditions was given; pMg might have been 3 (1mM MgCl2 is mentioned), and buffer might have been 50mM Tris-HCl. The concentrations of product and educt were determined by measuring the phosphate concentration after separation by ion chromatography."
